# YOLOR_object_detection

YOLOR (You Only Look Once with Rotation) is a real-time object detection algorithm that can detect objects in images and video frames. This project implements YOLOR using the PyTorch framework, and provides a pre-trained model that can detect a variety of objects in real time

Results
The YOLOR object detection algorithm has been tested on a variety of images and videos, and has demonstrated high accuracy and real-time performance. Here are some sample results:
